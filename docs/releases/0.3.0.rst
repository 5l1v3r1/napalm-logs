================================
Release 0.3.0 - Codename Backsaw
================================

The third major release comes with several core improvements and messages, as
well as more modules for the pluggable interfaces.

Core changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The internal pipeline for the internal communication between the napalm-logs
processes has been improved, now being based on ZeroMQ. The architecture
from the first release (see :ref:`release-0.1.0-architecture`) wasn't changed,
but rather improved following a standard
`Ventiallator Sink <http://zguide.zeromq.org/py:all#Divide-and-Conquer>`_
topology, where the Server is the ``ROUTER``, and each Device process is the
``DEALER``. This allows a better control and optimisation, as the user can start
more than one single Device process per platform class, using the new
:ref:`configuration-options-device-worker-processes` configuration option.
Increasing the number of Device processes will increase the processing speed.

Additionally, the memory consumption and can be better controlled using the
:ref:`configuration-hwm` configuration option, by adjusting the maximum buffer
size. For maximum capacity, this value can be set as ``0``, which means infinite
queue, so there won't be any messages dropped.
